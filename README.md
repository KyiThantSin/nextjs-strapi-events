# Nextjs-Events-Sharing

This is a small events sharing project built with Strapi and Next.js. The purpose of this is to allow users to share their events with others, while also providing them with the ability to manage their own events through a dashboard.

This was created as a way to practice implementing a web application using Strapi and Next.js, and to gain experience with these technologies.


## Features

- Authentication: Users can register and login to access the full functionality of the application. Only authenticated users can create, edit and delete their respective events, as well as see their dashboard. Public users can only see events, download and search for events.
- Dashboard: Authenticated users have their own dashboard where they can view and manage their events.
- Search: Users can search for events based on keywords.
- Dark mode: Users can switch between light and dark mode to suit their preferences.


## Technologies

- Strapi: A headless CMS that provides an easy way to create, manage, and publish content.
- Next.js: A popular React framework that enables server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and easy development.
